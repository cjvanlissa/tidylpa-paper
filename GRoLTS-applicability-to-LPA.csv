4,x,,,Is information about the distribution of the observed variables included?,Yes/No
5,x,,,Is the software mentioned?,Yes/No
6a.,?,Would this involve comparing any models to those with only a single class?,,"Are alternative specifications of within-class heterogeneity considered (e.g., LGCA vs. LGMM) and clearly documented? If not, was sufficient justification provided as to eliminate certain specifications from consideration?",Yes/No
6b.,?,Does this have to do with the six different models?,,"Are alternative specifications of the between-class differences in varianceâ€“covariance matrix structure considered and clearly documented? If not, was sufficient justification provided as to eliminate certain specifications from consideration?",Yes/No
7,,,,Are alternative shape/functional forms of the trajectories described?,Yes/No
8,?,Not sure if this is applicable,,"If covariates have been used, can analyses still be replicated?",Yes/No
9,x,"for Mplus, yes; not applicable for mclust (right now, at least)",,Is information reported about the number of random start values and final iterations included?,Yes/No
10,x,,,Are the model comparison (and selection) tools described from a statistical perspective?,Yes/No

13,?,"entropy is reported regardless, correct?",,"If classification of cases in a trajectory is the goal, is entropy reported?",Yes/No
14a.,x,nice plots! :),,Is a plot included with the estimated mean trajectories of the final solution?,Yes/No
14b.,?,"hmm, this seem slike something folks would want to include in an appendix - any thoughts?",,Are plots included with the estimated mean trajectories for each model?,Yes/No
14c.,?,"is this comparable to plotting the raw data with the estimates, as we do by default?",,Is a plot included of the combination of estimated means of the final model and the observed individual trajectories split out for each latent class?,Yes/No
